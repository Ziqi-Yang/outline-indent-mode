= Outline Indent Mode

This mode indents your document relaying on outline and behaves like what `org-indent-mode` do. \
Actually it uses `org-indent-mode`'s code. All credits belongs to `org-indent-mode`.

This mode works excellent on #link("https://git.sr.ht/~meow_king/typst-ts-mode")[typst-ts-mode]. However,
the experience on `markdown-mode` is actually awkward, and I believe the root source is from `markdown-mode` itself (specifically `markdown-outline-level`).
